Discord Channel Cleanup Service

Provides centralized channel maintenance and cleanup operations:
- Clean sweep bot messages
- Bulk delete operations
- Permission-aware cleanup
- Configurable thresholds and limits

Service-First Architecture:
- Single Source of Truth for Discord cleanup operations
- Used by multiple cogs and recovery systems
- Isolated, testable, and reusable
