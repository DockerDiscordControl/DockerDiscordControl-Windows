"""
DockerDiscordControl Progress Service (SPOT, Service-First)
- Event Sourcing + Snapshots on filesystem (JSON)
- Integer-only accounting (no floats)

Features:
- 11 levels (1..11), parallel Power & Evolution accumulation from donations
- Dynamic difficulty fixed only at next-level start (bins -> requirement)
- Exact-hit rule: on level-up, Power=1 if evo hits exact threshold, else 0
- Power daily decay (per mech-type configurable)
- Monthly gift (1..3 power) when power==0 (deterministic, idempotent)
- Donation deletion via tombstone + deterministic replay from snapshot checkpoint
- Idempotency keys for donations; optimistic concurrency on snapshots

Data layout:
  config/progress/events.jsonl                # global append-only event log
  config/progress/snapshots/{mech_id}.json    # last consolidated state per mech
  config/progress/config.json                 # service config (bins, requirements, decay)
  config/progress/member_count.json           # cached status-channel member count
