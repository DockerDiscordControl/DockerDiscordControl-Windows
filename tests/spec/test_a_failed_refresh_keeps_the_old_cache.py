"""
THE FINDING (review C7, section 34 F1): ``update_docker_cache`` empties the
cache BEFORE it refills it:

    docker_cache['containers'] = []
    for container in containers_limited:
        ... docker_cache['containers'].append(container_data)
    docker_cache['global_timestamp'] = current_time

``container.image.tags`` reads from the Docker daemon, and an image that was
removed under a running container - Unraid does exactly this when it recreates
one - raises ``docker.errors.NotFound``, a ``DockerException``. The loop then
stops halfway. The outer handler sets a loud "DOCKER CONNECTIVITY FAILURE"
error, but it restores nothing: ``containers`` keeps the half-built list and
``global_timestamp`` still names the LAST SUCCESSFUL refresh, because it is only
written after the loop. For the whole remaining cache duration,
``get_docker_containers_live`` computes a young cache age from that untouched
timestamp and serves the truncated list as fresh data. Every container the loop
had not reached yet has silently vanished from the web panel.

``container_hashes`` has the same problem in reverse: the aborted run writes the
hashes of the containers it did reach, so the hash table then describes data
that was thrown away. The next refresh finds "nothing changed" for them and
leaves their per-container timestamp alone.

The counter-check (test_a_successful_refresh_does_replace_the_list) holds the
other end: keeping the old cache on failure must not turn into keeping it on
success.

SINCE REVIEW E53 the trigger described above is gone: the image name is read
from ``attrs['Config']['Image']`` and ``container.image`` is never requested,
so a removed image can no longer stop the loop. The guard stays anyway, with a
synthetic failure inside the loop, because build-then-swap is what protects
the cache against the NEXT per-container lookup someone adds to that loop.
