"""Z3 - a container action that failed is reported as failed.

THE FINDING (stage 4 review pass 1, section 02 F2, re-checked 2026-09-19):
``run_docker_action`` (cogs/control_ui.py, ActionButton) awaited
``docker_action_service_first`` and only LOGGED its result. A failed start,
stop or restart (success=False - the service turns Docker errors into that)
went on exactly like a successful one: "Processing... please wait", then the
unchanged status. The user was never told the action had failed. (The
reviewer's other claim - the pending state sticks forever - is refuted: the
task's done-callback always clears it.)

HOW IT IS CHECKED: the button callback runs for real, as in
test_processing_message_fits_narrow_screens.py; the background task is
captured and run, waits are skipped, ``_`` is replaced by a marker.
