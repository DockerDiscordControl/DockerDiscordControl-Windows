"""Z5, second path - deleting scheduled tasks.

Z5 says: no intervention without channel permission, **on every path**. The
existing coverage (``test_z5_channel_permission.py``) only checks ``ActionButton``,
i.e. start/stop/restart. The second intervention path - deleting a scheduled
task - was not covered, and that is exactly where the gap is.

THE CHAIN, read through in full (2026-09-17)::

    InfoButton.callback           control_ui.py:1032 / :1086
      has_control = is_admin_control or <channel permission>  <-- title heuristic
      -> ContainerInfoAdminView   control_ui.py:1058 / :1093
         -> TaskManagementButton  status_info_integration.py:55  (unconditional)
            -> TaskManagementView              :1337
               -> DeleteTasksButton.callback   :1422   no check
                  -> ContainerTaskDeleteButton.callback :2567  no check
                     -> delete_task()          :2585

So an old message title ``Admin Control`` is enough to get a view from which
scheduled tasks can be deleted - without a CURRENT channel permission being
checked anywhere along the way. This is the same case for which the operator
decided on 2026-09-16 that old panels must be ineffective immediately;
``control_ui.py:304`` has already been fixed for that.

A MISTAKE OF MY OWN that belongs here: SPEC.md listed ``:1019-1025`` and
``:1072-1079`` as *"only toggle info display and admin buttons"* and thus as
purely presentational. That was wrong - they decide on building the view that
carries the delete path. The comment at ``:1053`` even says so openly:
"Don't re-check channel permission as it would ignore admin control context".

SECOND FINDING, same place: the same intervention requires the permission
``schedule`` on one path (``control_ui.py:1276``), and none at all on the other.
``status_info_integration.py`` does not know the string ``'schedule'``.

DELIMITED, because checked: the two web paths (``tasks_bp.py:194``,
``task_management_service.py:817``) hang on ``@auth.login_required`` - the
panel has its own permission model, not the channel model. They are not part
of this finding.

COUNTER-CHECK (performed 2026-09-17): 2 red, 1 green - exactly as predicted,
and both failures for the right reason.

*First:* the stack trace showed literally that ``control_ui.py`` built the view
although ``control: False`` was in the configuration - solely because of the
message title. *Second:* ``ContainerTaskDeleteButton`` did not contain the
string ``'schedule'`` anywhere.

Three traps had been named beforehand and none occurred: ``pytest-asyncio`` runs,
the tripwire on ``cogs.status_info_integration.ContainerInfoAdminView``
takes effect despite the function-local import, and the guard
``is_user_admin.called`` proves that the flow did not turn off earlier. The
opposite-direction test was green from the start - without it one could delete
building the view without replacement and the first test would stay green.

After the fix: 3 green. ``test_z5_channel_permission.py`` unchanged
3 green, ``tests/unit/cogs`` unchanged 267, ``tests/spec`` 57.

WHAT THE FIX CHANGES: at both places only the CURRENT channel permission
decides now, and the second delete path checks ``'schedule'`` like its
twin. A panel that was posted while the channel still had the permission
is ineffective after revocation - the operator's decision of
2026-09-16, applied here to two places that had back then been wrongly
classified as "purely presentational".
