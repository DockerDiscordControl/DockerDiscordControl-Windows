"""Z3/Z8 on the donation broadcast: no guessed success, no silent failure.

Z3 - No success is reported that did not happen.
Z8 - No silent failure on something irreversible.

A thank-you message to a Discord channel is irreversible. It may only go out
once the booking is confirmed - and only to channels that have not
unsubscribed from broadcasts.

Starting point (stage 0): there were **zero** tests on this entire path. Two
paths send the same message, and only one of them is careful:

* ``check_donation_notifications`` (docker_control.py:5165-5180) reads
  ``donation_broadcasts`` and sends only to channels that allow it.
* ``DonationBroadcastModal.callback`` (:4919-4946) walks the same
  ``channel_permissions`` list and **never** reads the flag.

Two paths lead here to a thank-you message without a booking:

1. If ``process_discord_donation`` raises, :4885-4887 catches the exception, sets
   ``evolution_occurred = False`` - and execution falls into the broadcast
   block at :4889. (A reported ``success=False``, by contrast, correctly leads
   to an early ``return`` at :4831-4837.)
2. If ``donation_manager_available`` is false, nothing is booked at :4789 in
   the first place - the broadcast runs anyway.

On robustness, honestly: this runs against imitated Discord objects.
It proves which calls the code triggers, not that Discord executes them that
way. Real proof would only come from the running bot.

The modal is deliberately not built via ``__init__``: the constructor pulls in
py-cord machinery and calls the real progress service via
``_get_dynamic_amount_placeholder()``. What is to be checked is ``callback``,
not the scaffolding.

COUNTER-CHECK (carried out 2026-09-16) - the way there is part of it:

*Two false starts, both my fault.* The first two runs were red with
``TypeError: 'MagicMock' object can't be awaited`` at :4964 - the stub did
not stub ``edit_original_response``. Red for the wrong reason proves
nothing; the stub was corrected, not the code. The list of ``await`` calls
to stub has since come from a complete search over :4731-4990 instead of
from repeated trial and error.

*Then justified red*, all three on their own assertion:

* ``...booking_raises``             -> ``assert {100: 1, 200: 1} == {100: 0, 200: 0}``
* ``...without_booking_service``    -> the same form
* ``...unsubscribed_channels``      -> ``assert 1 == 0``

*The first fix was incomplete, and the test showed it:* afterwards the result
was ``{100: 1, 200: 0}`` - the opt-out took effect, the booking block did not.
It depended on ``donation_amount_euros``, which is only assigned INSIDE the
skipped booking block (:4807) and therefore stayed ``None``. Switched to
``amount`` (the validated user input, set at :4753-4773). After that 14 green.

The permitted side of the block - without a stated amount the
"X supports DDC" message should still go out - is covered by
``test_without_amount_the_support_message_goes_out``. Without this case
one could tighten the block to "always block" and everything would stay
green.

This test also ran into a bug of its own and uncovered it:
``new_power = new_state.Power`` ran unconditionally, also in the ``else``
branch, in which ``new_state`` is never assigned. The line was also redundant -
both branches already set ``new_power``. The resulting ``UnboundLocalError``
(not NameError, as it first said here) fell through both ``except`` blocks,
the final response was never sent, and the user saw "Processing..."
permanently. Two more unconditional accesses to ``new_state.level`` stood
next to it; all three were switched to ``new_evolution_level``, which is set
in both branches.

Counter-check for that: before,
``UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'new_state'`` (1 red, 14
green), afterwards 15 green. The complete list of ``new_state`` accesses
was compiled before the fix, not discovered through repeated runs.
