"""When Docker is unreachable these must answer, not raise. Every caller expects a value.

THE FINDING (review E43, services/docker_service/docker_utils.py): seven
functions open with ``async with get_docker_client_async(...)`` and declare a
return type - ``bool``, ``List[Dict]``, ``dict``, ``str``. Their handlers list
``docker.errors.NotFound``, ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` and
``(DockerException, APIError, OSError, RuntimeError)``.

``get_docker_client_async`` raises ``DockerConnectionError`` when every way of
building a client has failed - the socket unmounted, the daemon stopped
(``docker_client_pool.py:731``). It is a ``DockerServiceError``, a
``DDCBaseException``, and it is in none of those tuples. So with Docker gone
these functions RAISE where their signature promises a value.

``docker_action`` is the one that matters: it is what start, stop and restart
go through, from the buttons and from the scheduled tasks at four in the
morning. Every caller reads its answer as "did it work"; an exception is not
an answer.

This is the same sentence as reviews E15 and E16, found by running the
DDC-exception scan over the WHOLE repository rather than only over the files
no pass had covered. E12 to E16 came from scanning 22 files; this came from
scanning 183.

The three diagnostics in the list are here too, because a diagnostic that
raises when the thing it diagnoses is broken is the least useful moment for it
to stop answering.
