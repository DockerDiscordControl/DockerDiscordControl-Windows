"""One container's failure does not drop the cooldown of the whole rule.

No ``@covers`` marker: a finding, not a guarantee.

THE FINDING (stage 4 review, stage B, section 11 F1, re-checked 2026-09-20):
an auto-action rule with several target containers records one outcome per
container. ``record_trigger`` set the RULE cooldown on SUCCESS and reset it
to 0 on FAILED - so with container A restarted successfully and container B
failing right after ("Container not found", a plain docker failure), the
rule's cooldown was wiped although the rule HAD just acted. The next
matching message triggers it again immediately, and A is restarted over and
over as long as the messages keep coming.

THE RULE NOW: a single container's outcome only moves that container's
cooldown. The rule's own cooldown is released once, by the caller, and only
when NOTHING in the batch succeeded.
