"""The mech sliders from the panel must differ and the buttons must carry them.

NO ``@covers`` marker: that would be a new guarantee, and guarantees are the
operator's decision.

THE ORIGINAL FINDING (fixed in commit 2970119). The panel offers seven
sliders for mech buttons (``mech_expand`` 3, ``mech_collapse`` 2,
``mech_donate`` 10, ``mech_history`` 5, ``mech_display`` 3, ``mech_story`` 5,
``mech_music`` 8). Only three mech buttons apply a cooldown at all - and all
three queried the slider of the INFO button::

    MechExpandButton    custom_id mech_expand_…    -> get_button_cooldown("info")
    MechCollapseButton  custom_id mech_collapse_…  -> get_button_cooldown("info")
    MechHistoryButton   custom_id mech_history_…   -> get_button_cooldown("info")

Two consequences for the operator: the ``mech_*`` sliders moved nothing, and
all mech buttons shared one bucket WITH the info button - whoever expanded the
mech display locked themselves out of the info display.

Corrected to ``self.custom_id``: ``get_button_cooldown`` has a prefix logic
that derives the slider ``mech_expand`` from ``mech_expand_12345``. It existed
AND was tested (``test_infrastructure_services.py`` checks
``mech_donate_123456`` -> 10), but nobody used it: a tested, dead path.

WHAT USED TO BE HERE AND WHY IT IS GONE. This file contained three more tests
(``test_expand/collapse/history_asks_its_own_slider``). They pinned down the
MECHANISM - the call to ``get_button_cooldown`` - and for that their fixture
set ``_last_click_<user>`` directly on the button.

Neither exists any more: the later switch to the spam service replaces
``get_button_cooldown`` with ``is_on_cooldown``/``add_user_cooldown`` and the
storage on the object with that of the service. So the three tests could not
be re-hooked - setup, recorder and assertion all encoded the old design.

They were NOT removed to get green, but because the same property - every mech
button is governed by its OWN slider - is checked more completely in
``test_mech_buttons_brake_through_the_service.py``: argument value, effective
slider value, recording of the press, rejection path per button,
``ephemeral`` and the removal of the volatile storage. Each of these
assertions is proven there by mutation to have teeth. What disappears is a
weaker duplicate, not coverage.

WHAT REMAINS HERE are the two guards - and they are worth it: the first pins
the IDs from which the prefix logic derives the sliders; the second, that the
three sliders are set DIFFERENTLY at all. Without the second a value check
elsewhere would be blunt; without the first the derivation would come to
nothing.

NO MORE LINE NUMBERS in this header: the earlier references (:2301, :2399,
:2531) had silently become wrong after two changes. Class names do not go
stale.

NOT PART OF THIS FINDING, recorded here so nobody investigates it twice:

* TEN more mech classes apply NO cooldown AT ALL (``MechDonateButton``,
  ``MechDisplayButton``, ``MechDetailsButton``, ``MechPrivateDonateButton``,
  ``MechPrivateHistoryButton`` and the views). A separate finding with its own
  behaviour change - already approved by the operator, not yet implemented.
* There is no class at all for ``mech_music``.
* The private buttons are called ``mech_private_donate_…``; the prefix logic
  derives ``mech_private`` from that - a key that does not exist. Whoever uses
  ``self.custom_id`` there lands on the 5-second fallback rule.
