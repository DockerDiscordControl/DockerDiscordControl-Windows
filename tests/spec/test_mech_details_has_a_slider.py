"""The mech details button must brake - and have a slider in the panel.

NO ``@covers`` marker: that would be a new guarantee, and those are the
operator's decision. The BEHAVIOUR CHANGE (unbraked mech buttons
brake) has been decided: "Yes, let the ten brake too".

THE FINDING. ``MechDetailsButton`` (``mech_details_<channel>``) does not ask the
spam service. Unlike the five buttons from commit 41faf4b there is also NO
slider here: no default value, no panel field, no catalog entry. Only building
in the brake would mean braking silently by the 5-second fallback rule - a
value the operator sees nowhere. That was exactly the finding for
admin/tasks/task_delete (commit 727324f).

WHY THE EXISTING CONTRACT DOES NOT CATCH IT: test_requested_
cooldown_keys_exist.py only sees literal keys; this button
asks via ``self.custom_id``. That is stated there as a limit in the header text.

THE DEFAULT IS 5, as for the related history button (mech_history). A TRAP,
named openly: 5 is also the fallback rule. A VALUE check could therefore not
distinguish whether the slider takes effect or the fallback rule. The slider
is proven here by the ARGUMENT, the default entry, the panel field and the
save block - each separately.
