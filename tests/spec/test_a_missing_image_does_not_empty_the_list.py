THE FINDING (review E53, reported by a user on GitHub 2026-09-22 against
v2.3.1): "app was working fine then all of a sudden there is no servers in my
discord channel. log into the app and there is no dockers to select, clicking
refresh just errors."

    ERROR in web_helpers: Docker connection error during live query:
    404 Client Error for http+docker://localhost/v1.47/images/6afa95.../json:
    Not Found ("No such image: sha256:6afa95...")

`container.image` is not a stored field. docker-py resolves it with an extra
request - `GET /images/<id>/json` - and when the image a container was created
from is gone, the daemon answers 404 and docker-py raises `ImageNotFound`.
Images disappear under containers in ordinary operation: an update that
recreates a container, a `docker image prune`, the containerd image store.

Three places read it, and one bad container did something different to each:

    app/utils/web_helpers.py            update_docker_cache
        the 404 left the loop, so the WHOLE refresh failed - every time,
        because the image stays gone. One container emptied the web panel's
        list. That is the reporter's log line.

    services/infrastructure/container_status_service.py  _query_container_sync
        `ImageNotFound` is a `NotFound`, so the outer handler reported the
        container as "container_not_found" - a running container, declared
        nonexistent, which is review C18's sentence in another file.

    services/docker_service/docker_utils.py  list_docker_containers
        caught the NotFound and `continue`d: the container silently dropped
        out of the list.

None of them needed the lookup. The image reference the container was created
with is already in `container.attrs['Config']['Image']`, delivered with the
container itself. Reading it there cannot 404, and it is one API call fewer
per container per refresh.

The fake below behaves like docker-py: `.image` answers for a container whose
image exists and raises `ImageNotFound` for one whose image is gone. So the
only thing wrong in these tests is the one thing that was wrong on the
reporter's host.
