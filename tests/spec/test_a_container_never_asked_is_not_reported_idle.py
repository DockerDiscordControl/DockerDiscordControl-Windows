"""A container whose status was never read is not reported as not running.

THE FINDING (review D14, pass 2, section 01 F3 and F4): both bulk buttons ask
`status_cache_service.get(docker_name)` and start from `is_running = False`.
When the cache has no entry for that container - right after it was added,
right after a restart before the cache is warm, or once the entry expired -
the lookup answers nothing, `is_running` keeps its default, and the container
lands in `skipped_count`.

The operator then reads "Skipped (not running): N containers". The container
was never asked and never touched, so what the report claims about it is a
measurement that was not taken. Both paths carry the same code and the same
sentence.
