"""Mech buttons whose panel sliders move nothing today must brake.

NO ``@covers`` marker: that would be a new guarantee, and those are the
operator's decision. The BEHAVIOUR CHANGE itself has been decided:
"Yes, let the ten brake too".

THE FINDING. The panel shows sliders for ``mech_donate`` (10), ``mech_display``
(3), ``mech_story`` (5) and ``mech_music`` (8). The corresponding buttons do
not ask the spam service at all::

    MechDonateButton    mech_donate_<channel>   -> mech_donate
    MechDisplayButton   mech_display_<level>    -> mech_display
    ReadStoryButton     read_story_<level>      -> (reaches no slider)
    PlaySongButton      play_song_<level>       -> (reaches no slider)
    EpilogueButton      epilogue_button         -> (reaches no slider)

The operator sets four sliders, and none of them brakes anything; the buttons
also bypass the per-minute limit.

"TEN" TURNED INTO FIVE WHEN MEASURED. The question to the operator counted
thirteen mech classes minus three braking ones. But among them are four views
(they do not brake themselves, their buttons do), a label field with
``disabled=True`` and two private buttons that FORWARD to MechDonateButton and
MechHistoryButton respectively. So the private history button already brakes
today, and the private donate button brakes with the public one. On the other
hand ReadStory, PlaySong and Epilogue were missing from the count - they are
not called "Mech...". My earlier statement "there is no class for mech_music"
was wrong: PlaySongButton is that class. MechDetailsButton does not brake
either, but has no slider at all - a separate finding.

THE NAMES, and why not ``self.custom_id`` everywhere: the prefix logic in
``get_button_cooldown`` only derives the slider from names that start with
``mech_``. ``read_story_4`` never reached ``mech_story``. Story, music and
epilogue therefore explicitly get ``mech_story_<level>``,
``mech_music_<level>`` and ``mech_story_epilogue`` - one bucket per level, as
MechDisplayButton already has via its ID today.

ONE PITFALL, named openly: ``mech_story`` is set to 5, exactly the fallback
rule. For story and epilogue only the ARGUMENT therefore proves the right
slider, not the value. The value check on refusal carries weight for donate
(10), display (3) and music (8).

WHERE THE BRAKE SITS: after the check "mech system disabled" (that is an
information message, not a work call) and before the ``defer`` - the refusal
therefore goes out via ``response.send_message``.
