"""A message shown to a user must go through ``_()``, or 40 languages are a lie.

THE FINDING (review E34): DDC ships forty locale files and a test,
``test_bot_strings_exist_in_the_catalog``, that checks every string passed to
``_()`` has a key in them. That test cannot see the failure that actually
happens, which is a message never passed to ``_()`` at all:

    await interaction.response.send_message(
        "❌ Error processing donation request. Please try again later.",
        ephemeral=True)

Measured when this was written: **42 such messages**, 39 of them in
``cogs/control_ui.py``. A German, French or Japanese operator gets those in
English, and nothing anywhere says so - the guard that exists asks the
opposite question.

A RATCHET, NOT A BAN IN ONE STEP, following the pattern
``test_codebase_is_english`` already sets: ``KNOWN`` lists how many plain
literals each file still sends. The contract fails when a file has MORE - and
when it has FEWER, so the list can only shrink and never lies. Translating
forty-two messages into forty languages is 1,680 entries; doing it in one
commit would be a worse change than the defect.

**THIS TEST HAS BEEN WIDENED TWICE AFTER REPORTING ZERO, both times because a
hand-read found what it could not see.** First it watched only
``send_message(...)`` and missed 33 texts inside embeds (review E35). Then it
watched embeds only as CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS and missed five more written as
``embed.description = "..."`` (review E38). And then it judged an f-string by
its FRAGMENTS, so ``f"❌ Container '{name}' not found"`` came apart into
``"❌ Container '"`` and ``"' not found"`` - both under the fifteen-character
floor, both invisible, while the message a user reads is neither (review E39).
Each time the number it printed was zero and each time that was false.

That is worth leaving in the docstring rather than tidying away: a guard is
only ever as wide as the shapes somebody thought of, and the way the missing
shapes were found both times was reading the code by hand. Most of what DDC shows is an
embed - the title, the description, the footer, the fields - so a guard that
only watched ``send_message(...)`` gave exactly the false comfort this whole
programme exists to remove. It was found by reading
``cogs/control_ui.py`` by hand two hours after the guard was written.

THE LIMIT OF THE DETECTOR, stated plainly: it looks for a bare string literal
passed as the first argument (or as ``content=``) to ``send_message``,
``send``, ``respond``, ``edit_original_response`` or ``edit_message``, and for
``title=``, ``description=``, ``text=``, ``name=`` and ``value=`` on
``discord.Embed(...)``, ``set_footer(...)`` and ``add_field(...)``. It counts
text longer than fifteen characters containing a space and at least one
letter, so ``"​"`` or ``"ok"`` do not register. An f-string is examined for its
literal PARTS, because that is how several of these are written - and a
fragment is exactly what must not be translated on its own, which is why they
are listed rather than wrapped.

A message built in a variable first is still not caught. It finds the shapes
that actually occur.
