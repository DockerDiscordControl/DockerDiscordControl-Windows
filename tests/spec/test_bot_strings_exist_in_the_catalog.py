"""Every literal bot string ``_("...")`` must be a key of ``locales/en.json``.

No ``@covers`` marker: that would be a new guarantee, and those are the
operator's decision.

WHY: the bot looks the source string up as the catalog KEY. A literal that is
not a key silently falls back to itself - untranslated for every server, with
no error anywhere. That risk is concrete right now: the German source strings
of cogs/enhanced_info_modal_simple.py were renamed to English keys in all 40
catalogs, and a single mismatch between code and catalog would go unnoticed.

KNOWN GAPS: four literals in cogs/docker_control.py have never had a catalog
entry (measured 2026-09-19: 597 literals, 4 missing). Two are user texts about
a donation that could not be recorded - every server sees them in English; two
are log texts wrapped in _() for no reason. They are listed below and may only
shrink; fixing them is a separate change.

THE LIMIT: only literal first arguments of a call to a plain name ``_`` are
checked. Strings built at runtime, or translated through another helper
(translation_manager.translate), are not seen.
