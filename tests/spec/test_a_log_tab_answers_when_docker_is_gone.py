"""
THE FINDING (review E46): C18 taught `_get_container_logs_sync` to say what
really went wrong - a `ContainerLogError` instead of a None that the caller read
as "no such container". It then taught the one caller it had in view,
`get_container_logs`, to answer that exception with a 500 that names it.

The other caller was left out, and it is the one the web panel actually uses.
The Bot, Discord, Web UI and Application tabs all go

    get_filtered_logs -> _get_bot_logs -> _get_filtered_container_logs
                      -> _get_container_logs_sync

and not one of those four handlers catches `ContainerLogError`:

    _get_filtered_container_logs   except (AttributeError, TypeError,
                                           RuntimeError, ValueError)
    get_filtered_logs              except (AttributeError, TypeError,
                                           ValueError, RuntimeError)
    the four routes                except (ImportError, AttributeError,
                                           RuntimeError) / (ValueError,
                                           TypeError, KeyError)

So when the log files are not there and Docker is unreachable - the moment the
operator opens a log tab to find out why - the exception walks out of the
service, out of the route, and Flask answers with its own HTML error page. The
log pane fills with markup instead of the one sentence that would have said
"Docker could not be reached".

`_get_filtered_container_logs` is declared `-> LogResult` and already answers
its sibling failure that way (`LogResult(..., status_code=404)` for a container
that is not there). The read failure now answers next to it, with a 500 that
names what happened, exactly as `get_container_logs` does.
