"""The stage 4 sectioning covers the application code without gaps.

NO ``@covers`` marker: that would be a new guarantee, and those are the
operator's decision.

WHAT THIS IS ABOUT: stage 4 requires a review with verifiable coverage.
For that, the application code is split in ``docs/quality/SECTIONS.txt`` into
sections of at most 2000 lines. The proof is only worth as much as the
guarantee that this list REALLY covers the tree completely - otherwise a
section is overlooked and nobody notices.

THE TRAP AVOIDED HERE: expectation and claim must not come from the same
source. The **claim** is SECTIONS.txt. The **expectation** is the tree
itself - all ``.py`` under cogs/, services/, app/, utils/ with their real line
counts. Deriving both from the section file would be a mirror test; exactly
such a one slipped past me today in the wiring test and stayed green with the
CSRF protection removed.

COUNTER-CHECK (carried out 2026-09-17): this test is green from the start - the
guarantee does hold right now. Its value therefore depends entirely on whether
it can bite at all. Four mutations of SECTIONS.txt, each on its own::

    file removed from the list          -> 1 failed
    gap torn open (range from 5)        -> 1 failed
    coverage ends before end of file    -> 1 failed
    section artificially over 2000 l.   -> 2 failed

The fourth turns two tests red, because an inflated range also falsifies the
coverage. Restored: 3 green, file bit-identical to the backup.

Without this check it would be a test that cannot fail - exactly the kind
that stage 3 weeds out. In the wiring test (test_app_factory_wiring.py) the
first version really was one: it took expectation AND claim from the same file
and stayed green with the CSRF protection removed.

SECTION STATUS: 38 sections, 187 pieces, 62,184 of 62,184 lines in
182 files. Four files exceed 2000 lines and had to be split;
``DockerControlCog`` is a SINGLE class of 4,485 lines and can only be cut
at method boundaries - a structural finding of its own, recorded in the
stage 4 report.
