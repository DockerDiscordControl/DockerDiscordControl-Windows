"""
THE FINDING (review C44, section 33 F2): the two donation commands are the only
ones whose cooldown is never explained to the user.

`on_command_error` starts with

    if hasattr(ctx, "command") and str(ctx.command) in ["donate", "donatebroadcast"]:
        return

before it has looked at the error at all. For every other command a cooldown
produces "This command is on cooldown. Please try again in ...". For these two
it produces nothing: no message, no log line. The user presses the button, sees
no reaction, and presses again.

The exclusion itself has a reason - the donate flow answers the interaction
itself, so a second response would fail - but that reason only covers the
branches that RESPOND with an error. The cooldown branch is the one place where
the command has not answered at all.

The counter-checks keep the exclusion doing its job for everything else, and
keep the other commands unchanged.

**What this test could not see (review E14, 2026-09-21).** Everything above is
true of the handler, and the handler was wired to an event DDC never fires:
``on_command_error`` is py-cord's PREFIX-command event, and every DDC command
is a slash command, whose errors go to ``application_command_error``. So the
symptom C44 describes - "the user presses the button, sees no reaction, and
presses again" - was still there afterwards, for every command and not just
the two donation ones.

This test stayed green through all of it, because it reaches into the handler
function and calls it. That is a fair way to test a handler's logic, and it is
why the logic was right. It simply never asked the other question: *does
anything call this?* The test for that is
``test_a_slash_command_error_reaches_the_user.py``.
