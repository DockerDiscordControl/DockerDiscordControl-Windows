"""One bad cycle must not end a background loop for the rest of the run.

THE FINDING (review E17, the first careful read of cogs/docker_control.py -
5,294 lines that no review pass ever covered, per docs/quality/COVERAGE_BY_FILE.txt).

Measured in the shipped py-cord (``ext/tasks/__init__.py``):

  * line 103  ``_valid_exception = (OSError, GatewayNotFound, ConnectionClosed,
                                    aiohttp.ClientError, asyncio.TimeoutError)``
  * line 171  only those are retried;
  * line 195  **anything else** sets ``_has_failed``, calls the loop's ``error``
              handler and re-raises - the loop is over, permanently, until DDC
              is restarted;
  * line 474  the DEFAULT error handler is a bare ``print()`` to ``sys.stderr``.

So a single ValueError, KeyError or DDC exception in a loop body stops that
loop forever, and DDC's own log never mentions it - no timestamp in DDC's
format, no logger, nothing that says "the status display is not updating any
more". The operator sees stale numbers and has nothing to look at.

Three of the eight loops had no guard of their own:

  * ``periodic_message_edit_loop``  - the status display refresh. The single
    most visible thing DDC does.
  * ``status_update_loop``          - the container status cache.
  * ``inactivity_check_loop``       - message regeneration.

and DDC registered **no** ``.error`` handler on any loop at all, so even the
guarded ones would have died in silence.

Both halves are pinned here: the body survives a bad cycle, and a loop that
dies anyway says so through the DDC logger.
