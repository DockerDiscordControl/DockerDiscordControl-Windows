"""The container list is the point of the overview. The mech is decoration on it.

THE FINDING (review E20, cogs/docker_control.py): both overview builders -
``_create_overview_embed_expanded`` and ``_create_overview_embed_collapsed`` -
assemble the container status lines first, set them as ``embed.description``,
and only then add the mech section. The mech section is wrapped in a handler
listing ``(discord.errors.DiscordException, RuntimeError, OSError, KeyError)``.

The mech services raise ``MechStateError -> MechServiceError ->
DDCBaseException``, and the cache service can raise ``AttributeError`` or
``ImportError`` on a bad import. None of those are in that tuple, so the
exception left the builder entirely - and the finished container list went with
it. The operator loses the thing they actually need (is my Minecraft server
up?) because of the thing they do not (an animated robot).

**The file already says this happened.** The comment at the top of that mech
block records two bugs that lived there until v2.4.1, the first of them:

    It imported MECH_LEVELS from services.mech.mech_service, which has never
    exported that name. The ImportError escaped the handler below (it only
    catches DiscordException/RuntimeError/OSError/KeyError), so expanding the
    mech section in Discord crashed outright.

That was repaired by fixing the import. The shape that let one bad import take
the whole overview down was left as it was.

The handler is broad now, and the counter-check keeps the point: the mech
FAILING must not become the mech silently showing nothing wrong.
