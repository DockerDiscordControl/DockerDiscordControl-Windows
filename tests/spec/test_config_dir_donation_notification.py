"""The donation notification from the web panel to the bot must live in ``DDC_CONFIG_DIR``.

NO ``@covers`` marker: that would be a new guarantee, and those are the
operator's decision.

THE FINDING. The notification is a HANDOVER: ``DonationService`` (web panel)
writes ``donation_notification.json``, ``DonationNotificationService`` (bot)
reads and deletes it. Both have ``/app/config`` HARD-wired::

    services/web/donation_service.py:55         NOTIFICATION_DIR = "/app/config"
    services/donation/notification_service.py:23  "/app/config/donation_notification.json"

They agree with each other - but both ignore the variable, and outside the
container (development run without /app) even creating the directory fails:
the donation announcement is lost, reported only in the log. In the test run
the writer, without redirection, targets the real /app/config (Z2).

SCOPE: ``NOTIFICATION_DIR`` stays as an adjustment knob - four test files set
it on the object. When unset (None) the shared source applies.

HOW IT IS CHECKED HERE: end to end - the real writer writes, the real reader
reads. Neither of them is redirected; only the variable is set.
