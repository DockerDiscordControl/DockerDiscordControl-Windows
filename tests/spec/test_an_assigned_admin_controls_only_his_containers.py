"""An assigned admin acts on their own containers, and on no others.

The enforcement half of the operator's request (review F2; F1 built the rule
and the format). In a status channel, where the channel permits nothing, the
global admin list is what lets an admin act (SPEC.md B2). With an assignment
in `admins.json` that right narrows to the containers named there.

WHAT MUST NOT CHANGE, and is checked here in every case: an admin WITHOUT an
assignment keeps every container. That is every admin until somebody makes
one, so getting it wrong would have locked the operator out of their own
installation on the first run.

And B1 is untouched. The channel branch is asked before the admin branch and
is not narrowed by anything - whoever may write in a control channel still
does everything there. The assignment bites only where the channel permits
nothing.

The sites covered: start/stop/restart (control_ui), deleting a task from the
control panel and from the info view (the two twins), and creating a task.
A task button knows its task and not its container, so the container is
looked up - but only for an admin who HAS an assignment, because for everyone
else the answer cannot depend on it and a missing task would otherwise refuse
somebody who is allowed today.
