"""A button must brake by the BUTTON slider, even if it is named like a command.

NO ``@covers`` marker: that would be a new guarantee, and those are the
operator's decision.

THE FINDING. ``is_on_cooldown``, ``get_remaining_cooldown`` and
``add_user_cooldown`` decide "command or button?" via a hard-wired NAME LIST
(``_BEFEHLSNAMEN``: serverstatus, ss, control, info, help, ping, donate,
command, language, forceupdate, start, stop, restart). If a BUTTON is named
like a command, it gets the command duration and counts toward the per-minute
command window::

    button "info"     -> command /info   5 s   instead of button slider info     3 s
    button "help"     -> command /help   3 s   instead of button slider help     5 s
    button "restart"  -> command         15 s  instead of button slider restart 20 s

Affected are the info button of the control panel, InfoDropdownButton,
HelpButton and the start/stop/restart buttons. The operator sets the "info
button" slider in the panel - and the slider of the /info COMMAND brakes. The
same kind of defect as with the mech buttons (the wrong slider applies), only
via a different path.

PART OF IT IS MY OWN MISTAKE: before the switch to the service,
InfoDropdownButton and HelpButton explicitly asked ``get_button_cooldown``.
The switch (commit 3785fc0) sends them through the name list. The tests of that
commit checked the ARGUMENT ("info", "help"), not the effective duration - and
therefore did not notice.

THE FIX: all current callers of the three methods are BUTTONS (measured;
commands brake via their own path in docker_control.py). So button becomes the
default; whoever wants to brake a command says so explicitly with
``kind="command"``. The name list goes away - together with its known quirks
("ss" is in no dictionary, "donatebroadcast" and "info_edit" are missing).

HOW IT IS CHECKED HERE: at service level, because that is where the bug sits,
with a real service and a frozen clock. That is the same clock replacement the
existing tests use (``time.time`` in the module), so that service and test see
the same time.

TWO TRAPS, sealed in advance:

1. If the button and command values were equal, every duration check would be
   hollow. The first guard pins that they DIFFER for info, help and restart.
2. ``kind=`` does not exist before the fix. A call with it would be an ERROR
   (TypeError) instead of a failure. The scope test therefore checks the
   signature first and fails cleanly on an assertion.
