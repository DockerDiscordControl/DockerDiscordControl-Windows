"""Z8 - a failed write of the game-query verdicts is visible in the log.

``game_query_support_service._atomic_update`` is the one writer of the
verdicts file: it carries the "supported" verdicts AND the ``testing`` flag
that drives the spinner of a manual re-test in the panel.

THE FINDING (stage 4 review pass 1, section 32 F1, re-checked 2026-09-19 -
the matter held, the reason did not): the reviewer blamed the bare
``except Exception: pass`` around ``support.set_testing(name, False)`` in
main_routes.py. That call cannot raise - ``_atomic_update`` below it already
swallows everything, and at DEBUG. So the spinner can indeed stay on
forever, but silently one level deeper than reported.
