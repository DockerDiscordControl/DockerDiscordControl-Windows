"""The per-minute limits in the panel must actually brake.

NO ``@covers`` marker: that would be a new guarantee, and those are the
operator's decision.

THE FINDING. The panel offers two fields - "max. commands per minute" (20)
and "max. buttons per minute" (30). Both are saved, both are passed back
and forth cleanly via ``to_dict``/``from_dict`` - and **nobody ever
queries them**.

Measured: the two names occur in the entire application code in exactly eight
places, all in ``spam_protection_service.py`` - field description
(:28-29), reading (:40-41), writing (:53-54), defaults (:314, :325). Not a
single place compares a counter with them, and there is no counting mechanism
anywhere.

WHAT THE OPERATOR SEES OF IT: he sets "max. 30 buttons per minute",
saves, sees the value again the next time he opens it - and nothing brakes.
Exactly the kind "unnoticed", which only shows when someone tries it on
purpose.

WHY IT NEVER STOOD OUT SO FAR: there is no place where a press is COUNTED.
The per-button cooldown only remembers the LAST point in time
(``_user_cooldowns``), not the number.

WHAT IS COUNTED IS THE ACCEPTED PRESS, not the query - so in
``add_user_cooldown``, not in ``is_on_cooldown``. If the check itself
counted, a refused repetition would use up further quota, and
legitimate use would be throttled. The test below records both.

THE CLOCK: the window uses ``time.time()`` - the same clock as the rest of the
file. ``time.monotonic()`` would be cleaner technically and is what
``SlidingWindowRateLimiter`` (translation_service.py:353) uses, but is
WRONG here: the existing tests freeze the clock via
``monkeypatch.setattr(time, "time", ...)``
(test_infrastructure_services.py:822, test_docker_infra_gaps.py:1594). With
``monotonic`` ONE service would run two clocks - ``_user_cooldowns``
frozen, the window real. A bug that only occurs under mocks
and stays invisible in operation.

DIFFERENT BUTTON NAMES IN THE TEST, and that is no coincidence: every ``probe_N``
falls to the 5-second fallback rule (``get_button_cooldown:186``), and none
locks the next. What still brakes after N presses can therefore ONLY be the
per-minute limit - not the per-button cooldown.

DELIMITATION: this test changes nothing about the question which of the 13
places ask the service at all. Most keep their own cooldown bookkeeping
and never reach ``is_on_cooldown`` - a separate finding with a separate
decision. Here it is only about the limit existing in the service at all
and biting.
