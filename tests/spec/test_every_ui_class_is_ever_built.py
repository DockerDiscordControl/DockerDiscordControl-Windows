"""No dropdown, view or button is defined that nothing ever builds.

No ``@covers`` marker: a finding, not a guarantee.

THE FINDING (stage 4 review, stage B, section 10 F2, re-checked 2026-09-20):
the reported defect was that the yearly task flow stores the date as one
"DD.MM" string while ``CreateTaskButton`` reads it with ``int(...)``, which
would raise on every yearly task. It cannot happen: the classes that store it
that way - ``YeardayDropdown``, ``ManualDateView``, ``DaySelectDropdown``,
``MonthSelectDropdown``, ``ConfirmDateButton`` - are never built. Nor are
``MonthdayDropdown`` (which cuts 1-31 down to the first 25 with
``options[:25]``, quietly dropping the 26th to the 31st) and ``DateDropdown``.
The flow that really runs asks for day and month separately
(``SimpleMonthdayDropdown`` + ``MonthDropdown``, review B21).

So it is not a crash but a trap: 250 lines of plausible, broken UI that a
reader takes for the live path.
