"""What one channel decides must not decide it for the channels after it.

THE FINDING (review E23, cogs/docker_control.py): ``_auto_update_ss_messages``
loops over every channel that has an overview message and decides, per
channel, whether to EDIT that message or to delete it and post a new one. The
flag it decides with is ``force_recreate`` - **the function's own parameter**,
reassigned inside the loop at three places (`:3468`, `:3551`, `:3561`).

So the flag is not per channel at all. The first channel whose decision says
"recreate" sets it, and every channel after it in the iteration inherits that
answer without its own decision ever being consulted:

    for channel_id, messages in self.channel_server_message_ids.items():
        ...
        if decision.should_recreate:
            force_recreate = True          # <- the parameter, not a local
        ...
        if force_recreate:
            await message.delete()         # and post a new one
        else:
            await message.edit(...)        # which is what was asked for

``_edit_only_ss_messages`` exists precisely to say "edit, do not recreate" -
it is what runs when somebody expands or collapses a mech panel. Pressing that
button in one channel could delete and repost the overview in a DIFFERENT
channel, which moves that message to the bottom of the channel and gives it a
new id. Which channels it happens to is decided by dictionary order.

The rate limiter three lines below makes the same mistake in the other
direction, and it is the clearer proof that per-channel was the intent:
``should_force_recreate(channel_id)`` takes a channel id, and its answer was
then written to a variable shared by all of them.
