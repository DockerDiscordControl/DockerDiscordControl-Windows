"""
THE FINDING (review C5, section 23 F1): a freshly built ``MechStateManager``
starts with an EMPTY cache even when ``mech_state.json`` is full. ``__init__``
sets ``state_cache = {}`` and calls ``_ensure_state_file()``, which only writes
when the file is missing - it never reads. Every write method
(``set_state``, ``set_expanded_state``, ``set_last_glvl``, ``mark_force_recreate``)
mutates that empty cache and then hands the WHOLE cache to ``save_state``, which
replaces the file. So the first write after a restart throws away everything
that was in the file: the other channels' expanded states, all remembered
Glvl values, and the overview message ids that exist precisely to survive a
restart.

WHAT THE REPORT GOT WRONG, stated plainly: it claimed the deployed bot loses
state. It does not. ``cogs/docker_control.py`` builds the singleton and calls
``load_state()`` on the very next lines, so in the running bot the cache is warm
before anything writes. The defect is in the class, not (today) in the bot: the
manager is only safe because one caller happens to repair it from outside, and
the second production caller - ``status_overview_service`` - relies on that
repair having happened.

Two counter-checks make sure these tests are not simply asserting "the file
never shrinks" - which a save_state that merged into the file instead of
replacing it would satisfy without ever reading anything: a manager started on
an EMPTY file must write only the new key, and a write that REMOVES an entry
must actually remove it on disk.
