"""Z4 - money is never credited twice or without proof.

Every donation carries an idempotency key that does not depend on the time of
day. Submitting the same thing twice yields one entry, not two - but a real
second donation from the same donor does yield two.

Decided by the operator (2026-09-16): the browser generates a one-time token
when the donation dialog opens and sends it along; the Discord path uses
``interaction.id``. Deliberately NOT chosen was a time window over
(donor, amount): that would have swallowed a real quick second donation and
thereby lost real money.

The finding is a pass-through bug, not a missing mechanism:
``ProgressService.add_donation`` already supports idempotency and is tested for
it (``tests/unit/services/mech/test_progress_service.py:322``). But the key gets
lost between the entry point and the service - ``DonationRequest`` has no field
for it, and ``processors.py:36/52`` passes none on. Without a key,
``progress_service.py:1024`` builds one from
``mech_id|donor|amount|utcnow().isoformat()``; two identical submissions
microseconds apart therefore count as different.

What is checked is the observable behaviour at the entry point, not the wiring
in between - otherwise the test would check the implementation instead of the
guarantee.

COUNTER-CHECK (done 2026-09-16), in two unequal halves:

*The three service tests* failed before the fix with
``TypeError: ... unexpected keyword argument 'idempotency_key'``. That is an
honest but **weak** red: it proves that the mechanism was missing at the entry
point, not that the guarantee was violated. Since the fix they check booking
counts instead of signatures and can therefore also fail in future if the
pass-through regresses.

*The two contract tests for the UI* were at first red for the WRONG reason -
the bug was in them, not in the code: the excerpt ended at the nested
``resetSubmitButton()``, and the list of allowed spellings did not recognise
the actual guard ``(window.crypto && crypto.randomUUID)``. Working code was
almost rebuilt until a broken test turned green. After fixing the test, the
counter-check was genuinely redone: ``idempotency_key`` renamed in the frontend
and the guard defused -> exactly these two tests red (9 green); file
restored -> 11 green.

Found and fixed along the way: ``FakeMechService.add_donation`` in
``tests/test_unified_donation_service.py`` pinned the old signature and
swallowed the key in the async path.
