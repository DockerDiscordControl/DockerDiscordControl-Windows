"""Guessing a container's protected password is limited to 3 tries per minute.

No ``@covers`` marker: an operator decision, taken on 2026-09-20.

THE FINDING (stage 4 review, stage B, section 07 F4): ``PasswordValidationModal``
compared the entered password with ``!=`` and had no limit at all - anyone
who may open the modal (everyone in a control channel, SPEC.md B1) could
resubmit it as often as they liked, and every wrong try was only written to
the action log. The operator decided the limit: **three attempts per minute**
per person.

The fourth try inside the window is refused WITHOUT looking at the password,
the window is rolling, and a correct password clears the record so the owner
is never locked out by their own earlier typos.
