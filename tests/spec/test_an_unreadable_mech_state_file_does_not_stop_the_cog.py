"""A mech state file nobody can read must not take Docker control down with it.

THE FINDING (review E21, cogs/docker_control.py ``__init__``): the cog's
construction opens with

    logger.debug("Step 1: Loading mech state...")
    try:
        state_data = self.mech_state_manager.load_state()
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"[DEBUG INIT] Step 1 FAILED: {e}", exc_info=True)
        raise

and ``raise`` there is right for a constructor - a half-built cog is worse than
none. The problem is one level down. ``MechStateManager.load_state`` catches
``(FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError)`` and returns ``{}``, which handles
a missing file and a corrupt one. It does not handle a file that exists, is
valid, and **cannot be opened**.

``PermissionError`` is an ``OSError``, not a ``FileNotFoundError``. So it
escapes, Step 1 re-raises, the cog is never constructed, the extension fails to
load - and DDC has no container commands at all. Every start, until somebody
works out that a JSON file holding which mech panels were expanded is the
reason ``/serverstatus`` no longer exists.

**This is not hypothetical on this install.** Files written by a root-owned
process have broken this app before; it is why every `docker exec` here runs
`-u ddc`.

What the persisted state buys is real and it is not container control: mech
expand states, Glvl tracking, and the overview message ids that let a restart
delete an old overview instead of posting a duplicate. Losing those is a bad
morning. Losing Docker control is a broken bot. So the file is read
defensively, and a failure that is NOT simply "no file yet" is logged at ERROR,
because that one an operator can actually fix.
