# Configuration Path Information

This application uses the following configuration file:

    /app/config/config.json

This file is a volume mount to:

    /mnt/user/appdata/dockerdiscordcontrol/config/config.json

on the host system.

IMPORTANT: All components (Web-UI, Bot, Config-Loader) consistently use this path.
Changes must be made to the host file.

Configurations in the main directory (/app/config.json) are NOT read!
