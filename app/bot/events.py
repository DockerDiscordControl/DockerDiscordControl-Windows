        Registered for BOTH events on purpose. ``on_command_error`` belongs to
        py-cord's PREFIX commands, and DDC has none - ``factory.py`` sets a
        command_prefix, but not one ``@commands.command`` exists in the repo.
        Everything DDC offers is ``@commands.slash_command``, and py-cord sends
        those errors to ``application_command_error`` instead
        (``commands/core.py:483``), where the default handler prints to stderr
        and answers the user not at all (``bot.py:1219``).

        So this handler used to be wired to an event that never fired, and an
        interaction that failed was left hanging: the user saw the command
        thinking, and then nothing. Review C44 read that symptom correctly -
        "they pressed the button and pressed again" - and installed the cure on
        the wrong event (review E14). The cooldowns are real:
        ``dynamic_cooldown_manager.py`` sets ``command._buckets`` on the slash
        commands at startup, which is what py-cord checks before invoking.

        ``on_command_error`` keeps its registration. It costs nothing, and a
        prefix command may exist one day.
