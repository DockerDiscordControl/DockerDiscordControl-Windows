# The rate limit for the action log. It used to sit in the `except ImportError`
# arm of a `try: from app.blueprints.log_routes import rate_limit`, under a
# comment reading "Fallback: ... if import fails" - but log_routes defines no
# rate_limit and never did, so the import always failed and this was never a
# fallback. It is the only implementation there has ever been.
#
# The try/except is gone rather than kept "just in case": an except ImportError
# around a module that DOES exist would also swallow an ImportError raised
# inside log_routes.py itself, and a broken dependency there would quietly
# become "use the fallback" with nobody told (review D30).
