"""The two mechanical scans from the stage-4 review, made repeatable.

Both came out of section 26 (`scheduler.py`), where the same sentence turned
up three times by hand: *a failure that looks like an empty result*. One
sentence found three times by hand is a sentence worth looking for by machine.
See `docs/quality/reviews/SCANS_2026-09-21.md` for what they found.

    scan 1  --falsy    every `except` block that answers with None/False/[]/{}/''
    scan 2  --ddc      every narrow `except (...)` in front of a call that can
                       raise a DDCBaseException

READ THIS BEFORE BELIEVING A HIT.

Scan 2 matches **by name**. It builds the set of function and method names in
the repo that raise a DDC exception, then flags calls to those names sitting
under a handler that cannot catch one. It cannot tell two methods apart that
share a name - and they do: `spam_service.save_config` returns a ServiceResult
and raises nothing, while `config_service.save_config` raises ConfigSaveError.
That pair produced a false positive in the first run of this scan.

So: **a hit is a question, not a finding.** Read it back to the definition
that is actually called before it counts as anything. And a narrow handler is
not a defect when the right handler is one frame up - which is how
`configuration_save_service.py` came out of the first run clean.

Neither scan finds behaviour. They find shapes.

    have missed E12, the finding this whole script came out of: the handler

    calls ``_heal_if_lagging`` under the lock, and THAT raises. One level of
    distance was enough to hide it from a reader, and it would have been enough
    to hide it from a direct-only scan. `--selftest` pins exactly that.

    Propagation is by NAME and it is deliberately generous: a call inside a try
    whose handler catches everything does not propagate, and nothing else is
    subtracted. Depth is capped because without a cap most of the repo ends up
    marked, and a scan that flags everything says nothing.
