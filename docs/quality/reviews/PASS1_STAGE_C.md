# Stage 4 review - pass 1, stage C (2026-09-20 / 21)

The remaining seventeen sections, the ones the user does not see: the
configuration services (12), the Docker client pool and its helpers (15, 16),
the infrastructure services (19, 20), the mech (21, 22, 23), the scheduling
helpers (25), translation (27), the web save and status services (28, 29, 30),
the Docker status path (33), the web helpers and diagnostics (34), logging and
time (35) and the utility modules (36). One pass each, reviewer model
**Sonnet**, the code was written and fixed by Opus. Same package as stages A
and B (`scripts/review/build_package.py`): the section's source with real line
numbers, `SPEC.md`, the section's check plan and `REVIEW_TASK.md`.

**One pass is a sample, not a review** - the same caveat as stages A and B. 86
findings were reported across the seventeen sections.

As the reviewer graded them: 2 critical, 23 high, 36 medium, 25 low; and 43
of the 86 were marked "unsure". That last number is the useful one - his
prompt says a reviewer who is never unsure has not read carefully - and the
unsure ones were not the weak ones: C56 (every container listing raised
TypeError) came in as "high / sure", but C68 (the evolution bar pinned at
100 %) and C73 (the level-up freeze) were both "unsure".

**82 fixed, 2 refuted, 2 made moot, 0 still open.** Each fix is one commit
with its own waiting test, an announced mutation probe and a test run whose
numbers were announced beforehand; the commit message says where a prediction
was wrong. Up to review C67 that meant a full run of all 43 groups per
finding. From C67 on it means the affected groups per finding and a full run
whenever a change crosses module boundaries or closes a section - the
operator asked whether running 5,000 tests after a one-line change made
sense, and it did not. Every commit says which of the two it did.

The suite grew from 4,895 to **5,214** passing tests over the 76 commits.

## The two that did not survive re-measurement

- **28 F3** - step 3 of `save_configuration` puts its failure reason in
  `.message` while the other paths use `.error`. The route reads
  `save_result.error or save_result.message or 'Failed to save
  configuration.'`, so the reason reaches the operator either way and no test
  can show a difference. Recorded rather than changed (C48). What remains is
  a trap rather than a defect: a future caller reading only `.error` would
  lose the reason for the most common failure of the lot.

- **28 F7** - `_build_translation_text` was said to drop an embed without the
  coverage check its comment promises. The comment is wrong, the behaviour is
  not: `et_lower in content_lower` requires the whole embed text to be inside
  the message, and there is no input where the condition throws away
  something that is not already there. The comment was corrected and
  characterisation tests added so the two cannot drift apart again (C49).

## The two that had already gone

**25 F3** and **25 F4** name `create_and_save_task` and
`handle_schedule_command_error` in `services/scheduling/schedule_helpers.py`.
Review C2 had removed both as dead code before stage C reached section 25 -
their only caller was `cogs/scheduler_commands.py`, the slash commands
removed in review B17.

## Classes closed rather than single sites

Three findings turned out to be instances of a shape that sat in many places,
and each is now held shut by a scan in `tests/spec/`:

- **C17** (30 F1, F2) - an `except` clause that names an attribute of a
  module which may be `None` after a defensive import. Building the tuple
  raises `AttributeError` at the moment the handler was meant to rescue the
  situation (`test_no_except_clause_needs_a_missing_module.py`).
- **C25** - a durable file written with `open(..., "w")`, which truncates
  before the new content exists (`test_durable_files_are_written_atomically.py`).
- **C60** (16 F5) - `asyncio.CancelledError` named in a tuple with ordinary
  errors, so a cancellation is swallowed like a failure. Fifteen places
  (`test_a_cancellation_is_not_an_error.py`).

## Found while reading, not in the report

- **C57** - both error handlers in `test_docker_performance` built their
  result entry by calling `get_container_timeouts()` again - the very call
  that can put the loop into those handlers. The tool died on the container
  it was asked to diagnose.
- **C56** - besides the reported `Lstat=True`, `get_containers_data` read
  `c_data['State']` once as a string and once as a dict, so every running
  container came back as `error_processing`. An existing test described that
  correctly in its own comment and asserted it as the expected result.
- **C61**, **C71** - two modules shaped like the thing they are named after
  and wired to nothing: a `before_invoke` hook that always said yes, and a
  member-count cache that handed out a fixed 50 with a fabricated timestamp.

## What this does not say

"Touched" is not "reviewed". The 37 sections cover 60,984 lines and every one
of them has been read once by one model. A second pass over the sections that
carry secrets, permissions or money is still open, as is the split of
`DockerControlCog`.
