# Stage 4 review - pass 2, stage A (2026-09-20/21)

The same eight sections as pass 1, chosen by "would the user notice it": money
(17, 18, 24), permissions (01, 02, 31, 32), containers and deleting (14). One
pass each, reviewer model **Sonnet**, one reviewer per section, each seeing
only its own package directory. The code was written and fixed by Opus.

**Why a second pass at all.** The programme text measured three passes of the
same reviewer over one section at 9, 10 and 7 findings with **pairwise overlap
zero**. Pass 1 closed with the sentence "each of the eight was looked at ONCE
by ONE reviewer; by the programme's own number, a second pass would find
mostly different things". This is that second pass, and the number below says
how well that held here.

Reports: `pass2/sNN/REPORT.json` in the session scratchpad, built by the same
tooling as pass 1 (`scripts/review/build_package.py`, `check_plan.py`,
`coverage.py`).

## Coverage

| Section | Names | Judged | Findings | of which "unsure" |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | 23 | 23 | 5 | 4 |
| 02 | 24 | 24 | 4 | 3 |
| 14 | 43 | 43 | 5 | 2 |
| 17 | 61 | 61 | 3 | 2 |
| 18 | 87 | 87 | 6 | 4 |
| 24 | 40 | 40 | 5 | 2 |
| 31 | 51 | 51 | 5 | 3 |
| 32 | 45 | 45 | 5 | 2 |
| **total** | **374** | **374** | **38** | **22** |

**374 of 374 names judged, 0 not_checked, 0 invented.** No reviewer had to be
sent back this time; the two failure modes of pass 1 (bare names instead of
`path:line name`, and a repeated name judged once) did not recur.

The name count differs from pass 1 (374 against 395) because the sections
themselves changed: the code was repaired 86 times between the passes, and the
check plan is generated from the current source.

## How much of it was new

This is the number the second pass exists to produce, and it is worth being
careful with, because "the same finding" is a judgement and not a measurement.
Three ways of counting, from loosest to tightest:

| Measure | Overlap | What it is worth |
|---|---|---|
| Same file, within 60 lines of a pass-1 finding | 21 of 38 (55 %) | **Over-counts.** Two findings can sit in one function and be unrelated. |
| Judged by hand while the work was done | **11 of 38 (29 %)** | The figure this report stands behind. |
| Same file AND the same line number | 4 of 38 (11 %) | **Under-counts.** The same defect gets described at different lines. |

So **the brother's "pairwise intersection zero" does not hold exactly here** -
roughly three in ten findings were in ground pass 1 had already stood on. But
71 % were new, which is the point: one pass is a sample.

## The two findings that make the case for more than one pass

Both were found **inside a repair pass 1 had just made**. Verified against the
history rather than remembered:

- **D1** (24 F1) corrects `_heal_if_lagging`, and that method was introduced
  by `d3ddcdb` - the commit for pass 1's **A1**. The healing that pass 1 built
  to stop a donation being buried could itself refuse to heal and say nothing,
  and the caller then buried the donation anyway.
- **D4** (14 F1) changed `channel_cleanup_service.py` lines 227-255; **A11**
  (`16d5bb4`) had rewritten 223-233 two days earlier. The repair landed inside
  the block the previous repair had just written.

A reviewer reading fresh code reads it as code. A reviewer reading a repair
tends to read the repair's own reasoning with it. That is the argument for a
second pass that no overlap percentage can make.

## The two findings that make the case for writing decisions in the code

Twice, pass 2 produced **the same false positive as pass 1**, without ever
having seen pass 1's verdict:

- **01 F1/F2** (bulk restart/stop check the admin list and not the channel).
  Pass 1 found it as 01 F1 ("high") and refuted it: SPEC.md **B2**. Pass 2
  found it again and called it **critical**, twice. Both were wrong, and the
  suggested fix would have re-created a regression the operator had already
  suffered once (the Z5 fix of 2026-09-16/17, undone on 2026-09-19).
- **32 F2 / A10** (the game-query retest spinner that stays on). Here the two
  passes named **different mechanisms** for the same symptom - pass 1 the
  swallowed cleanup write, pass 2 the worker that never starts - so both were
  real, and both are fixed.

The first of these changed how the repair was made. A decision that lives only
in `SPEC.md` and a review document does not stop the third reader from
"fixing" it. B2 is now written at both call sites and pinned by
`tests/spec/test_the_bulk_buttons_answer_to_the_admin_list.py`, whose probe M3
adds exactly the check both passes asked for and turns red.

## Every finding was re-checked against the code

As in pass 1, not one finding was adopted unchecked, and each was repaired in
its own commit with a waiting test that was announced before it was run.

**38 of 38 dealt with: 34 repaired, 2 refuted-and-pinned, 2 refuted as stated
with a different real repair found underneath.**

### Refuted as stated

| Report | Verdict |
|---|---|
| 31 F2 (D21) | The rejected edit already left the task alone. Pinned rather than repaired. |
| 31 F3 (D30) | The import does fail, but it is caught by design. The dead `try` branch was removed and the working rate limit pinned. |
| 01 F1, 01 F2 (D36) | SPEC.md B2, as in pass 1. The real defect underneath: the confirmation press authorised nothing at all. |

## What this pass does NOT say

- **How much was reviewed cannot be stated by section number, and three
  attempts to do so have all been wrong.** Section numbers are not stable
  identifiers: the boundaries have been re-cut repeatedly, including six times
  during pass 2 alone, so today's number 37 is not the 37 any pass-1 report
  meant. Matching one against the other produces a confident and false answer.

  The three attempts, all corrected: `STAGE4_REVIEW.md` said "every section of
  the code base has been read once"; the first version of this line said "29 of
  38 sections have not been reviewed in either pass"; the second said "13, 26
  and 37 have never been reviewed by anyone". **The third is refuted by the
  code itself:** `key_crypto.py` sits in today's section 37 and was reviewed in
  pass 1 as **section 35 F3**, repaired as C14 (`2f7ac2d`) - the comment is
  still in the file.

  What can be said, and no more: no pass-1 report names `scheduler.py` or
  `config_service.py` anywhere, and a first careful read of `scheduler.py`
  produced five findings (`SECTION_26_SCHEDULER.md`). That is consistent with
  it never having been read, and it is not proof - a report only names the
  files that produced findings, so a file reviewed with none leaves no trace.

  **The structural lesson, which is worth more than the number:** coverage was
  tracked by section number while the sections themselves were being re-cut by
  the same work that tracked them. Nothing in the bookkeeping was keyed by file,
  so no one - reviewer, operator or me - could answer "has this file been read?"
  without guessing.

  **Closed on 2026-09-21** by `docs/quality/COVERAGE_BY_FILE.txt`, rebuilt from
  the reviewers' own packages: for each file, which pass and section was handed
  which LINE RANGE of it. Paths do not move. It puts numbers on the question
  for the first time - **160 of 182 files carry evidence, 22 carry none, and 72
  of the evidenced ones are only partly covered: 5,556 lines were never in any
  package.** Held against the tree by
  `tests/spec/test_coverage_by_file_is_complete.py`.

  It immediately corrected me a third time. `scheduler.py` reads
  `pass1:s27:1996-2165` - 170 lines of validation helpers at the end of the
  file, and nothing else. Reading the evidence mark without the range says
  "reviewed"; reading the range says the 1,995 lines where all five findings of
  `SECTION_26_SCHEDULER.md` sit were in no package. The ranges are the point.

  Both caveats belong with the numbers: pass 1 stage B ran before packages were
  kept, so its files show as NONE though they were reviewed - the counts are a
  floor on what has been read, never a ceiling. And the ledger records what was
  HANDED to a reviewer, which is not the same as what was read carefully:
  `scheduler.py` produced no pass-1 finding from its 170 reviewed lines, and a
  hand read of the rest produced five.
- **The first version of this line said "29 of 38 sections have not been
  reviewed in either pass", and `STAGE4_REVIEW.md` said "every section of the
  code base has been read once". Both were wrong, in opposite directions**, and
  neither was checked against the reports until the operator pushed back on a
  recommendation built on them. 26 sections have had exactly one look, 8 have
  had two, 3 have had none.
- So the eight sensitive sections have now been read twice while three
  sections central to configuration, scheduling and token encryption have not
  been read at all. That is the next work, not a release.
- Each of the eight was looked at once more, by one reviewer. A third pass
  would find fewer new things than this one - 29 % overlap after one repeat
  suggests the seam is not exhausted, but it is narrowing.
- 22 of 38 findings were marked "unsure" by the reviewer. That ranking is not
  adopted anywhere; the re-check decides, and two of the four "critical" ones
  were wrong.
- Severity as the reviewer ranked it is not the severity that mattered. The
  two "critical" findings in section 01 were refuted; the finding that
  actually left a visible, permanent failure in Discord (D31, a message stuck
  on "Processing...") was ranked **medium/unsure**.

## What the method produced besides repairs

At least twelve of the thirty-six commits record a **mis-announcement of my
own** - a mutation probe, a waiting test or a full-run total where the number
I announced was not the number I measured (D11, D14, D17, D20, D25, D28, D29,
D31, D32, D33, D34, D35; the count is a floor because the wording varies and
I counted by grep). Each is written into its commit with the reason. Three of
them found a weakness in the test rather than in the code:

- **D31 M2**: the test checked that a message had left "Pending" and never
  which of two messages arrived - the distinction the repair exists for.
- **D33 M1/M3**: the test checked that a label no longer said "no action" and
  never that anything was deleted. A label can lie.
- **D28**: a test case of mine demanded that `1.2.3.4.5` be refused. It is a
  legal DNS name. The code was right.

A probe that comes out at the announced number confirms the fix. A probe that
does not is worth more, because it is usually the test that is wrong - and a
test nobody has tried to break is a test nobody has checked.
