"""One way to read an Advanced Setting - config first, environment second.

The panel offers 23 ``DDC_*`` keys and writes them into
``config['advanced_settings']`` (config_form_parser_service.py:415-425). Nine
places read three of those keys straight from ``os.environ`` instead, so they
never saw what the user had set: the setting worked in the web part and was
silently ineffective in the Discord part. No error, no hint - the classic "the
user notices nothing" case.

``app/utils/web_helpers.py:_get_advanced_setting`` already did the right thing,
and cogs/status_handlers.py:341 even imports it - but that module pulls ``docker``
and ``werkzeug`` at import time, so using it from the Discord side drags half the
web part along. Hence this module: no imports beyond the standard library at
module level.

Two deliberate differences from the original:

* The config service is imported INSIDE the function. Every other module in
  ``utils/`` does it that way, and a module-level import here would read
  configuration during import - the very thing fixed in docker_utils.py today.
* A fallback to the environment is LOGGED. The original swallowed the failure
  silently, which is exactly the "values quietly tidied away" pattern this
  programme hunts. Removing one silent site while building the next one would
  be a poor trade.
