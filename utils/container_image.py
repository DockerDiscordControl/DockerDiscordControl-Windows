"""The image a container runs, read without asking Docker a second time.

``container.image`` in docker-py is not a stored field. It sends
``GET /images/<id>/json``, and when the image a container was created from has
been removed from the host the daemon answers 404 and docker-py raises
``ImageNotFound``. That happens in ordinary operation: an update that recreates
a container, a ``docker image prune``, the containerd image store.

DDC read ``container.image`` in three places, and one container with a removed
image emptied the web panel's container list, reported a running container as
nonexistent in Discord, and dropped it from the bot's list (review E53, a user
report against v2.3.1).

None of them needed the lookup: the reference the container was created with
is already in ``attrs['Config']['Image']``, delivered with the container
itself. Reading it there cannot fail this way, and it saves one API call per
container per refresh.

No imports on purpose - this is called from the web panel, the status service
and the Docker utilities, and must not pull any of them into the others.
